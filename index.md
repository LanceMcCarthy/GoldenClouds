## Check-in

Once you have the gate fob and keys, here is how to use them:

![keys](https://dvlup.com//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FobAndKeyInstructions.png)

* The key works on all door locks
* The locks have internal deadbolts, you may need to turn the key 3 times to unlatch.
* We recommend entering through the kitchen door. It is the **2nd** door, the one with the screen.

## Check-out

Checking out is straightforward:

1. You can leave all the soiled laundry on the bed you used.
2. Close all the doors and any windows you've opened.
3. Turn off any lights or fans that you turned on.
4. Close the electronic gate and put the keys back into the lockbox (close the lid until the lock latches, then spin the number wheel to scramble it).

Thank you!

## Rooms and Amenities

Here is a list of all the major items/features of the property, with some guidance and recommendations on use.

* **Bathrooms**
  *   Extra shampoo, conditioner and soap can be found in the bottom drawer of bathrooms. Extra towels and linens can be found in the cabinets of the rear bedroom.
  *   The house uses a septic tank, please do not flush anything except the toilet paper we supply (and ehem, you know what).
      *   Things like paper towels and sanitary items can result in a backup and is a quick way to have an uncomfortable experience during your stay 😢. There's a wastebasket next to each toilet for these items and plenty of extra trash bags.
  *   Every bathroom has a shower that has its own hot water boiler/tank. It can get hot fast, so test it before jumping in.
* **Game Room**
  *   The chair hammock is rolled up on top of the game cabinet. There is a bracket already connected to the patio scaffolding, please only use the hammock there.
  *   Board games are located in the game room, in the game cabinet.
      *   Some games are brand new, feel free to open them. Please return them to the same location.
  *   There is an Xbox One in the game room, but it is not hooked up yet.
* **Yoga Room**
  *   This room has yoga mats, ball and weights.
  *   This room also doubles as a private office if you do not want to work at the desk in the living room. You can bring the gameroom table in there, if you’d like.
  *   It has ambient lighting via an LED strip. You can change the color and brightness using the 3-button controller next to the cabinet. The strip will automatically change at sunset and sunrise.
* **Kitchen**
  *   The kitchen is at your disposal, here are a few important things to keep in mind
  *   Be sure to clean up thoroughly when you’re done. Remember that you’re in a jungle, any dropped food or scraps will attract insects.
  *   There is no garbage disposal, food scraps should be thrown out into the jungle instead of a trash bag.
  *   If you trip a breaker, you can find the panel in the yoga room.
  *   Although Arenal water is very pure, the kitchen’s water has its own filter and hot water system.
  *   Clothes washer and dryer are in the kitchen, behind the closet doors.
* **Off-limits Areas**
  *   There are only two internal areas that are off-limits, both rooms have an electronic key-coded door lock. These rooms are for maintenance and owner access only.
  *   The bodega (tool closet) is outdoors. This is not a guest area, but if you do need a rake or shovel for some reason, your door key will open it. However, we ask that you contact Roy for anything that requires these items, he will handle it.
* **Windows, Fans and Air Conditioners**
  *   Arenal is always ~72 degrees (22 Celsius) and comfortable year-round, the A/C only gets turned on a couple times a year. To use the fans, open the kitchen door, patio door and some side windows, the breeze through the house is amazing. Just don’t forget to put in the screen when you open a window.
  *   If you do need the A/C, the one in the back bedroom is newer and more efficient than the living room one. These are operated with a remote control, but you may need to turn on the breaker first. The front breaker panel is in the yoga room, the rear breaker panel is in the rear bedroom. **If you have trouble with A/C, please contact Roy on Whatsapp**, he will help.
* **Hot Tubs**
  *   The external hot tub is manually filled and drained, this is handled by the property manager, Roy. If you need any assistance with this, please contact Roy or Lance (numbers above).
  *   The internal hot tub is located in the rear bathroom. Fill it using the shower faucet. To use the water jets, push down the white button on the rim of the tub (just make sure there is enough water before turning on the jets).
* **Night-time Tips**
  *   Keep the screen door shut if you’re on the patio. We have excellent, non-toxic pest control on the grounds, but you still don’t want a firefly beep-booping around the house while you’re trying to sleep.
  *   Sunset is absolutely breathtaking, grab a chair on the patio, a drink and watch the pastel color show. Use `#GoldenCloudsArenal` and `#NeuvoArenal` hashtags on social. Pro-tip: If you’re showering in the front bathroom at this time of day, slide open the window to get the view!
  *   At night, especially right after sunset, bright lights will attract insects. I recommend shutting the kitchen door if you have the bar lights/kitchen lights on. This will prevent finding a bunch of insects just outside the door in the morning.

## Property Boundary

The property lines have a boundary marked by a wired fence, _please stay within these bounds for your safety and security_. For example, the lot down the hill has domesticated animals (cows), please do not climb over the fence to take photos as this is very dangerous and very steep.

#### Pets 

If you have pets with you, we strongly recommend initially having them on a leach while out in the backyard for a few reasons:

* The fences will not keep an untrained or determined dog inside the property.
* The neighbor on the left has an old yellow Golden Retriever dog.
    * It is a timid and stays away from people.
    * If the house has been empty for a while and someone new arrives, he'll bark from his yard complaining that "you're on his mountain". Don't worry about this, he gives up after 10 or 15 minutes.
* Occasionally, 2 or 3 of the neighborhood miniature dogs go on a field trip together and go hiking through everyone's yards on the street (these are the same little guys who lay in the middle of the road)
    * They pass through in a couple minutes.
    * Although they appear to be friendly, do not engage and just ignore them. 

Since we don't know how your pet behaves, we cannot assume responsiblility for their actions. So, we urge a bit of caution and play it safe at first.

## Onsite Technology

### Golden Clouds Technology Map

The house has modern internet and security features. From high-speed fiber-optic internet to automated lighting that changes colors through-out the day, you can rest and/or work from paradise. If you're a nerd like me, here's a topological map.

![tech map smaller](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/173123965-d574ac07-489b-4eac-bdef-5fd4691628f5.png)

### Wi-Fi

This is the same kind of Wi-Fi that you’ve used at airports, hospitals, stadiums, etc. 

1. Connect to `Golden Clouds Guest` (no password).
2. Your device should automatically open the Terms of Service (ToS) web page
    * If it doesn't open automatically, open a web browser on your device and go to any website (this will force it to load).
3. Accept the ToS and you're done.

This what the ToS acceptance page looks like:

> If you have trouble with the Wi-Fi, message Lance. He can fix it in just a couple minutes from anywhere in the world (because he's a nerd 🤓).

### Security Cameras

There are security cameras on the property, please read and understand this section so that you know when they're operational.

* The 3 internal cameras only face the common areas; **Living Room**, **Game Room** and **Hallway**. These are not recording, or detect motion, while there is a guest on the property.
  * You can confirm a camera is disabled because there is no blue operational light. **If you see the blue light turned on, contact Lance ASAP** so we can turn it off immediately.
  * ![g3 instant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/173119017-314d9687-0a32-48be-b860-fb89e9156fd8.png) 
* Optional: Overnight Security - If you would like the security cameras to detect motion while you are sleeping, let us know. We can enable just the overnight schedule, which only detects and records motion between 0:00-4:00. To protect your privacy, the overnight schedule is only enabled if you ask for it.

> There are two temporary WiZ cameras: one in the living room on top of the blinds, and one on the window sill that faces the backyard. The internal camera will be rotated to face the wall while a guest is present. If you see this facing the living room, contact Lance immediately so we can fix it.
