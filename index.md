## Check-in

### Gated Entrance and Keys

Attached to the front of the gate is a little lockbox that contains the keys. Enter the 4-digit combination and pull down the latch to open the box.

Once you have the gate fob and keys, here is how to use them:

![keys](https://dvlup.com//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FobAndKeyInstructions.png)

### Key Operation

* The key works on all door locks
* The locks have double locking mechanism, you may need to turn the key 3 times to unlock & unlatch.
* We recommend entering through the kitchen door (it's the 2nd door in the driveway, the one with the screen).

## Check-out

Checking out is straightforward:

1. You can leave all the soiled laundry on the bed you used.
2. Close all the doors/windows you've opened and turn off any lights or fans that you turned on.
3. Close the electronic gate after you've driven out 
4. Lock the keys away in the lockbox you got the keys from, then spin the number wheel to scramble the code.

This is our home, not just an investment property for Airbnb, so we thank you for being considerate!

## Rooms and Amenities

Here is a list of all the major items & features of the property, with some guidance and recommendations.

* **Bathrooms**
  *   Extra shampoo, conditioner and soap can be found in the bottom drawer of bathrooms. Extra towels and linens can be found in the cabinets of the rear bedroom.
  *   The house uses a septic tank, please do not flush anything extra except the toilet paper we supply (it's made for septic tanks).
      *   **Warning**: Things like paper towels and sanitary items will result in a backup and is a quick way to have an uncomfortable experience during your stay 😢. There's a wastebasket next to each toilet for these items and plenty of extra trash bags.
  *   Every bathroom has a shower that has its own hot water boiler/tank. It can get hot fast, so test it before jumping in.
* **Game Room**
  *   The chair hammock is rolled up on top of the game cabinet. There is a bracket already hanging on the patio scaffolding, only connect the hammock to that hook.
  *   Board games are located in the game room, in the game cabinet (you can open any new games).
* **Yoga Room**
  *   This room has yoga mats, ball and weights.
  *   This room also doubles as a private office if you do not want to work at the desk in the living room. You can bring the gameroom table in there, if you’d like.
  *   It has ambient lighting via an LED strip. You can change the color and brightness using the 3-button controller next to the cabinet. The strip will automatically change at sunset and sunrise.
* **Kitchen**
  *   The kitchen is at your disposal, here are a few important things to keep in mind
  *   Be sure to clean up thoroughly when you’re done. Remember that you’re in a jungle, any dropped food or scraps will attract insects.
  *   There is no garbage disposal, food scraps should be thrown out into the jungle instead of a trash bag.
  *   If you trip a breaker, you can find the panel in the yoga room.
  *   Although Arenal water is very pure, the kitchen’s water has its own filter and hot water system.
  *   Clothes washer and dryer are in the kitchen, behind the closet doors.
* **Trash**
  *   The city of Arenal has trash service every week on Thursday morning (5AM-7AM)
  *   The cleaning service will take care of any trash. However, if you are staying longer than average guest, you might need to take some bags out. Please only use the metal trash bin to the right of the gate, in this photo:
      *   ![trashbin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/179368463-44689124-083d-4bea-bc88-95f4c323773f.jpg)
* **Off-limits Areas**
  *   There are only two internal areas that are off-limits, both rooms have an electronic key-coded door lock. These rooms are for maintenance and owner access only.
  *   The bodega (tool closet) is outdoors. This is not a guest area, but if you do need a rake or shovel for some reason, your door key will open it. However, we ask that you contact Roy for anything that requires these items, he will handle it.
* **Windows, Fans and Air Conditioners**
  *   Arenal is always ~72 degrees (22 Celsius) and comfortable year-round, the A/C only gets turned on a couple times a year. To use the fans, open the kitchen door, patio door and some side windows, the breeze through the house is amazing. Just don’t forget to put in the screen when you open a window.
  *   If you do need the A/C, the one in the back bedroom is newer and more efficient than the living room one. These are operated with a remote control, but you may need to turn on the breaker first. The front breaker panel is in the yoga room, the rear breaker panel is in the rear bedroom. **If you have trouble with A/C, please contact Roy on Whatsapp**, he will help.
* **Hot Tubs**
  *   The external hot tub is manually filled and drained, this is handled by the property manager, Roy. If you need any assistance with this, please contact Roy or Lance (numbers above).
  *   The internal hot tub is located in the rear bathroom. Fill it using the shower faucet. To use the water jets, push down the white button on the rim of the tub (just make sure there is enough water before turning on the jets).
* **Night-time Tips**
  *   Keep the screen door shut if you’re on the patio. We have excellent, non-toxic pest control on the grounds, but you still don’t want a firefly beep-booping around the house while you’re trying to sleep.
  *   Sunset is absolutely breathtaking, grab a chair on the patio, a drink and watch the pastel color show. Use `#GoldenCloudsArenal` and `#NeuvoArenal` hashtags on social. Pro-tip: If you’re showering in the front bathroom at this time of day, slide open the window to get the view!
  *   At night, especially right after sunset, bright lights will attract insects. We recommend keeping the kitchen door closed if you have the bar lights/kitchen lights on. This will prevent finding a bunch of insects just outside the door in the morning.

## Property Boundary

The property lines have a boundary marked by a wired fence, _please stay within these bounds for your safety and security_. For example, the lot down the hill has domesticated animals (cows), please do not climb over the fence to take photos as this is very dangerous and very steep.

#### Pets 

If you have pets with you, we strongly recommend initially having them on a leash while out in the backyard for a few reasons:

* The fences will not keep an untrained or determined dog inside the property.
* The neighbor on the left has an old yellow Golden Retriever dog.
    * It's relatively timid and stays away from people.
    * If the house has been empty for a while and someone new arrives, he'll bark from his yard complaining that "you're on his mountain". Don't be concerned, it gives up after 10 or 15 minutes.
* Occasionally, 2 or 3 of the neighborhood miniature dogs go on a field trip together and go hiking through everyone's yards on the street (these are the same little guys who lay in the middle of the road)
    * They pass through in a couple minutes.
    * Although they appear to be friendly, do not engage... just ignore them. 

Since we don't know how your pet behaves, we cannot assume responsiblility for their actions. So, we urge a bit of caution and play it safe at first.

## Onsite Technology

### Golden Clouds Technology Map

The house has modern internet and security features. From high-speed fiber-optic internet to automated lighting that changes colors through-out the day, you can rest and/or work from paradise. If you're curious, here's a topological map.

![tech map smaller](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/173123965-d574ac07-489b-4eac-bdef-5fd4691628f5.png)

### Wi-Fi

This is the same kind of Wi-Fi that you’ve used at airports, hospitals, stadiums, etc. 

1. Connect to `Golden Clouds Guest` (no password).

    * If it doesn't open automatically, open a web browser on your device and go to any website (this will force it to load).
3. Accept the ToS and you're done.

This what the ToS acceptance page looks like:

### Security Cameras

There are security cameras on the property, please read and understand this section so that you can feel comfortable and confident during your stay.

The 3 internal cameras that only face the common areas. They are all in clear view of occupants; **Living Room**, **Game Room** and **Hallway**. These are not recording while there is a guest on the property.

* **Internal Cameras - Disabled** - During your entire stay, the 3 internal cameras are set to Privacy Mode from 1:00 PM on the day of your check-in and ends on 11:00 AM on the day of your check-out. This *completely blacks out all the pixels at the firmware level.*
* **Guest Access** - If you would like access to the camera system, so you can manually enable or disable Privacy Mode, let Lance know and he'll enable the Home Assistant guest account.
    1. Go to [Golden Clouds - Home Assistant](https://ha.goldenclouds.dvlup.com) and login (this is a webpage, not an app)
        * **Username**: `localguest`
        * **Password**: `This is newly created for every guest`
    2. **Operating Privacy Mode**
        1. Click the little eye icon to enable or disable Privacy Mode
        2. Wait ~5 seconds for the mode to be applied to the device. In this screenshot, the camera on the left has Privacy Mode turned on.
            * ![HA home page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/185434001-62ca3173-6636-4ef5-a6aa-6066d0d3f197.png)
            * ![privacy mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/185434308-c15c4f63-29b9-44f7-9987-867001ae20e0.png)
* Please do not **move**, **remove**, **reposition**, or **unplug** any security devices (loss of power will trigger a security event). Any damage to security devices resulting from guest manipulation will be the responsibility of the guest and submitted to AirCover for reimbursement.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not remain silent! Message Lance on AirBnb and he will respond quickly to answer all your questions.
