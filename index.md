## Check-in

### Gated Entrance and Keys

Attached to the front of the gate is a little lockbox that contains the keys. Enter the 4-digit combination and pull down the latch to open the box.

![lockbox](https://dvlup.com//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Key-Lockbox-Instructions-1024x770.png)

Once you have the gate fob and keys, here is how to use them:

![keys](https://dvlup.com//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/FobAndKeyInstructions.png)

### Key Operation

* The key works on all door locks available to guests.
* The locks have double locking mechanism, you may need to turn the key 3 times to unlock & unlatch.
* You must enter through the kitchen door (it's the 2nd door in the carport, the one with the screen door). The first door is a utility room and is inaccessible to guests.

## Check-out

Checking out is straightforward:

1. You can leave all the soiled laundry on the bed you used.
2. Close all the doors/windows you've opened and turn off any lights or fans that you turned on.
3. Turn of any Air Conditioners
4. Close the electronic gate after you've driven out 
5. Put the keys back in the lockbox, scramble the code and close to lock it.

This is our home, not just an investment property for Airbnb, so we thank you for being considerate!

## Rooms and Amenities

Here is a list of all the major items & features of the property, with some guidance and recommendations.

* **Bathrooms**
    * Extra shampoo, conditioner and soap can be found in the bottom drawer of bathrooms. Extra towels and linens can be found in the cabinets of the rear bedroom.
    * The house uses a septic tank, please do not flush anything extra except the toilet paper we supply (it's made for septic tanks).
      * **Important**: Non-toilet paper items (paper towels, sanitary items, etc) *will* result in a backup and is a quick way to have an uncomfortable experience during your stay 😢. There's a wastebasket next to each toilet dedicated for these items and plenty of extra trash bags in case you want to empty it early (this is common behavior in Costa Rica).
    * Every bathroom has a shower that has its own hot water boiler/tank, we recommend the main bathroom for showering. Water can get hot really fast, so start with a tiny bit of hot water, then add cold. Always test it before jumping in :)
* **Back Patio**
  * There are two chair hammocks available above the game room cabinet. These hammock chairs hook into the rings in the overhead structure.
  * Full hammock. We do not yet have a dedicated place to hook this up to yet, please do not use this one.
* **Game Room**
  *   Board games are located in the game room, in the game cabinet (you can open any new games).
  *   There is an Xbox available, but it is not hooked up. If you require this for any kids, the property manager can bring out the TV from the storage room.
* **Yoga Room**
  *   This room has yoga mats, ball, weights, and a mirror.
  *   This room also doubles as a private office if you do not want to work in the living room with gorgeous view. The gameroom table can be moved in there to act as desktop, the living room desk is very heavy and should be moved.
  *   There is LED ambiance lighting in this room. You can change the color and brightness using the 3-button controller next to the cabinet or the controller from the kitchen. The strip will automatically change at sunset and sunrise.
* **Kitchen**
  *  The kitchen is at your disposal, here are a few important things to keep in mind
  *  Be sure to clean up thoroughly when you’re done. Remember that you’re in a jungle, any dropped food or scraps will attract insects.
  *  There is no garbage disposal, food scraps should be thrown out into the jungle instead of a trash bag.
  *  If you trip a breaker, you can find the panel in the yoga room.
  *  Although Arenal water is very pure, the kitchen’s water has its own filter and hot water system.
  *  Clothes washer and dryer are in the kitchen, behind the closet doors.
* **Trash**
  *  The city of Arenal has trash service every week on Thursday morning (5AM-7AM)
  *  The cleaning service will take care of any trash. However, if you are staying longer than average guest, you might need to take some bags out. Please only use the metal trash bin to the right of the gate, in this photo:
      *   ![trashbin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/179368463-44689124-083d-4bea-bc88-95f4c323773f.jpg)
* **Off-limits Areas**
  *   There are only two internal areas that are off-limits, both rooms have an electronic key-coded door lock. These rooms are for maintenance and owner access only.
  *   The bodega (tool closet) is outdoors. This is not a guest area, but if you do need a rake or shovel for some reason, your door key will open it. However, we ask that you contact Roy for anything that requires these items, he will handle it.
* **Windows, Fans, Air Conditioners**
  *  Arenal is always ~72 degrees (22 Celsius) and comfortable year-round
  *  Open the windows, patio door and turn on the ceiling fans to get an excellent whole-house breeze.
    * Each window has a screen next to it, insert the screen after opening the window    
  *  For the rare hot/humid times, there are two brand-new A/C units (bedroom and living room). Please do not forget it off when not in use or while the doors/windows are open. You can use smart timers, if you're familiar with the controls.
* **Jacuzzis** - `[unlisted feature]`
  * These are not in the online listing because they break frequently and we do not want to always promise their availability. If it is working while you're there, that's great... but if it is not, please keep this non-dedication in mind when leaving a review :)
      *   **Outdoor Jacuzzi**: We are waiting for a new control unit, which limits the temperature. In the meantime, guests can still use it as everything works, but only of the property manager (Roy) sets it up for you at specific temperature. `This is for your own safety! Do not attempt to operate it yourself, you run the risk of serious physical harm due to overheating`.
      *   **Indoor tub**: The indoor one does not have operational jets, but it still can be used for hot bubble baths w/candles or the room's LED lighting.
* **Night-time Tips**
  *   Keep the screen door shut if you’re on the patio. We have excellent, non-toxic pest control on the grounds, but you still don’t want a firefly beep-booping around the house while you’re trying to sleep.
  *   Sunset is absolutely breathtaking, grab a chair on the patio, a drink and watch the pastel color show. Use `#GoldenCloudsArenal` and `#NeuvoArenal` hashtags on social. Pro-tip: If you’re showering in the front bathroom at this time of day, slide open the window to get the view!
  *   At night, especially right after sunset, bright lights will attract insects. We recommend keeping the kitchen door closed if you have the bar/kitchen lights on. This will prevent finding a bunch of insects just outside the door in the morning.

## Property Boundary

The property lines have a boundary marked by a wired fence, _please stay within these bounds for your safety and security_. For example, the lot down the hill has domesticated animals (cows), please do not climb over the fence to take photos as this is very dangerous and very steep.

#### Pets 

If you have pets with you, we strongly recommend initially having them on a leash while out in the backyard for a few reasons:

* The fences will not keep an untrained or determined dog inside the property.
* The neighbor on the left has an old yellow Golden Retriever dog.
    * It's relatively timid and stays away from people.
    * If the house has been empty for a while and someone new arrives, he'll bark from his yard complaining that "you're on his mountain". Don't be concerned, it gives up after 10 or 15 minutes.
* Occasionally, a couple of the neighborhood's small dogs go on a field trip together and hike through everyone's yards on the street (these are the same little guys who lay in the middle of the road)
    * They pass through in a couple minutes.
    * Although they may appear to be friendly, do not engage... just ignore them. 

Since we don't know how your pet behaves, we cannot assume responsiblility for their actions. So, we urge a bit of caution and play it safe at first.

## Onsite Technology

### Golden Clouds Technology Map

The house has modern internet and security features. From high-speed fiber-optic internet, to automated lighting that changes colors through-out the day, you can rest and/or work from paradise.

### Wi-Fi

This is the same kind of Wi-Fi that you’ve used at airports, hospitals, stadiums, etc. 

1. Connect to `Golden Clouds Guest` (no password).
2. Your device should automatically open the Terms of Service (ToS) web page, just like airports and coffee shops.
3. Accept the ToS and you're done.

This what the ToS acceptance page looks like:

![guest wifi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/173122916-10271660-8cdf-4d39-8a6c-6cdf2537f3a4.png)

> If you have trouble with the Wi-Fi, message Lance in the AirBnb/Vrbo app. He can usually fix it in just a couple minutes remotely.

### Security Cameras

It is really important that you read and understand this section so that you can feel comfortable and confident with your privacy during your stay.

There are security cameras on the property, this is a fact of life in Costa Rica that you will find on many properties.

There are only 3 internal cameras facing the common areas. They are all in clear view of occupants; **Living Room**, **Game Room** and **Hallway**. These are all electronically blacked out at the firmware level (see screenshots below), and the guest can use the camera covers if they desire.

1. The internal cameras all have a blackout feature that is enabled during guest stays.
2. **__DO NOT__** unplug or reposition the cameras, this will trigger security alert. *Use the provided camera covers instead*.
3. The guest can access and enable or disable the camera blackout (see the [Guest Camera Access](#camera-access) section below). This might be something you want if you're away from the property for a large portion of the day.
4. Camera Privacy Covers - You will find three blue covers in the kitchen, they are made out of opaque material and look like this:
    -  ![privacy covers](https://github.com/LanceMcCarthy/GoldenClouds/assets/3520532/1dd13ce6-c01b-4a49-ae66-304ee7f3fa63)


#### Guest Camera Access

If you would like access to the camera system, so you can manually enable or disable Privacy Mode, let Lance know and he'll enable the Home Assistant guest account.

1. Click this link => [Golden Clouds - Home Assistant](https://ha.goldenclouds.dvlup.com) and login:
    * **Username**: `guest`
    * **Password**: `reservation's first name (lowercase)`
2. Operating **Privacy Mode**
    1. Click the little eye icon to enable or disable Privacy Mode
    2. Wait ~5 seconds for the mode to be applied to the device. In this screenshot, the camera on the left has Privacy Mode turned on.
      * ![HA home page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/185434001-62ca3173-6636-4ef5-a6aa-6066d0d3f197.png)
      * ![privacy mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/185434308-c15c4f63-29b9-44f7-9987-867001ae20e0.png)

> Again, please do not **move**, **remove**, **reposition**, or **unplug** any security devices. This is sensitive electronic equipment connected to a sophisticated security system that will send a security alert if a device is powered off or repositoned. Any damage to security devices resulting from guest manipulation will be the responsibility of the guest and submitted to AirCover for reimbursement.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not remain silent! Message Lance and he will respond quickly to answer all your questions.

## Food Recommendations

There are soooo many amazong places to eat in just the small area of Arenal. IT takes a week just to go to them all. Let me share our favorite places:

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ El Corral BBQ - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/vZkXCBSiJ6DmTyZQ7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vZkXCBSiJ6DmTyZQ7)
  - This is hands-down, our absolute favorite place, we go there every. single. day.
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Moya's Place - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/PyL9zM12X2yzDcyR7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PyL9zM12X2yzDcyR7)
  - Great for quick lunch or dinner, right in the middle of town and has a great ambience
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Cafe Macadmaia - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/vZkXCBSiJ6DmTyZQ7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vZkXCBSiJ6DmTyZQ7)
  - A local and visitor favorite. The patio has unparallel views of the lake. Their blended drinks are a must-try.
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Los Platillos Voladores - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/PyL9zM12X2yzDcyR7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PyL9zM12X2yzDcyR7)
  - Don't let the location's appearance fool you, her italian food rivals the best in any city.

You can always ask Roy for recommendations based on a specific topic and where you're willing to go. 

> If you are vegan, vegitarian, or gluten-free, there are plenty of menu options available for you at these locations. Although I can't speak directly to this, I have taken gluten-free vegan friends with me and they were happy with the options.
