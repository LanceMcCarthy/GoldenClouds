Welcome to Golden Clouds, in Arenal Costa Rica! I’ve written this webpage to help give you the information you need for your first stay.

I ask that you take 5 minutes to read through this guide because it contains important information about the property, amenities, technology in use (Wi-Fi, security cameras) and other “pro-tips” that will make your experience as pleasurable as possible.

## Contacts

If you have any questions during your stay, there are a few options available depending on your circumstance.

    *   Whatsapp `+506 8501 7756` (for any problems or questions with the property)
*   **Lance** and **Irina** - Host
    *   Use AirBnb Messenger (for casual questions)

Tip - Roy is an excellent resource to ask about anything local; from arranging a personal chef that will cook for you in the house to a guided tour of the volcano. He literally knows everyone in the area and is an all-around rockstar. 

## Gated Entrance and Keys

Attached to the front of the gate is a little lockbox that contains the keys. Enter the 4-digit combination and pull down the latch to open the box.

## Rooms and Amenities

Here is a list of all the major items/features of the property, with some guidance and recommendations on use.

* **Bathrooms**
  *   Extra shampoo, conditioner and soap can be found in the bottom drawer of bathrooms. Extra towels and linens can be found in the cabinets of the rear bedroom.
  *   The house uses a septic tank, please do not flush anything except the toilet paper we supply (and ehem, you know what).
      *   Things like paper towels and sanitary items can result in a backup and is a quick way to have an uncomfortable experience during your stay 😢.
      *   There is a wastebasket next to each toilet and plenty of extra bags for these items.
  *   Every bathroom has a shower that has its own hot water boiler/tank. It can get hot fast, so test it before jumping in.
* **Game Room**
  *   The chair hammock is rolled up on top of the game cabinet. There is a bracket already connected to the patio scaffolding, please only use the hammock there.
  *   Board games are located in the game room, in the game cabinet. You can use any games, many are new and need to be opened. Please return them to the same location when finished.
  *   There is an Xbox One in the game room, but it is not hooked up yet.
* **Yoga Room**
  *   This room has yoga mats, ball and weights.
  *   This room also doubles as a private office for working space, if you do not want to work at the desk in the living room. You can bring the game room’s table in there, if you’d like.
  *   It has ambient lighting via an LED strip. You can change the color and brightness using the 3-button controller next to the cabinet. The strip will automatically change at sunset and sunrise.
* **Kitchen**
  *   The kitchen is at your disposal, here are a few important things to keep in mind
  *   Be sure to clean up thoroughly when you’re done. Remember that you’re in a jungle, any dropped food or scraps will attract insects.
  *   There is no garbage disposal, food scraps should be thrown out into the jungle instead of a trash bag.
  *   If you trip a breaker, you can find the fuse panel in the yoga room.
  *   Although Arenal water is very pure, the kitchen’s water has its own filter and hot water system.
* **Off-limits Areas**
  *   There are only two internal areas that are off-limits, both rooms have an electronic key-coded door lock. These rooms are for maintenance and owner access only.
  *   The bodega (tool closet) is outdoors. This is not a guest area, but if you do need a rake or shovel for some reason, your door key will open it. However, we ask that you contact Roy for anything that requires these items, he will handle it.
* **Windows, Fans and Air Conditioners**
  *   Arenal is always ~72 degrees (22 Celsius) and comfortable, the A/C gets turned on maybe 2x a year. Open the kitchen door, patio door and some side windows, the breeze through the house is amazing. Just don’t forget to put in the screen when you open a window (screens are next to each window)
  *   If you do need the A/C, the one in the back bedroom is newer and more efficient than the living room one. These are operated with a remote control, but you _may_ need to turn on the breaker first. The front breaker panel is in the yoga room, the rear breaker panel is in the rear bedroom. **If you have trouble with this, please contact Roy on Whatsapp** before playing with breakers, he will help.
* **Hot Tubs**
  *   The external hot tub is manually filled and drained, this is handled by the property manager Roy. If you need any assistance with this, please contact Roy or Lance (numbers above).
  *   The internal hot tub is located in the rear bathroom. Fill it using the normal shower valves. To use the water jets, push down the white button on the rim of the tub (just make sure there is enough water before turning on the jets).
* **Night-time Tips**
  *   Keep the screen door shut if you’re on the patio. We have excellent, non-toxic pest control on the grounds, but you still don’t want a firefly beep-booping around the house while you’re trying to sleep.
  *   Sunset is absolutely breathtaking, grab a chair on the patio, a drink and watch the pastel color show. Use `#GoldenCloudsArenal` and `#NeuvoArenal` hashtags on social. Pro-tip: If you’re showering in the front bathroom at this time of day, slide open the window to get the view!
  *   At night, especially right after sunset, bright lights will attract insects. I recommend shutting the kitchen door if you have the bar lights/kitchen lights on. This will prevent finding a bunch of insects just outside the door in the morning.

## Property Boundary

The property lines have a boundary marked by a wired fence. _Please stay within these bounds for your safety and security_. If you have pets with you, 

For example, the lot down the hill has domesticated animals (cows), please do not climb over the fence to take photos as this is very dangerous and very steep.

#### Pets 

If you have pets with you, we strongly recommend initially putting them on a leach while out in the backyard for a few reasons:

* The fences will not keep in a determined dog inside the property
* The direct neighbor has a yellow Golden Retriver-like dog (it stays away from people, but sometimes like to look upon us from within its yard).
* Sometimes the other tiny neighborhood hotdogs go on a field trip together and go hiking through everyone's yards. They typically pass through in a couple minutes.

Since we don't know how your pet behaves and cannot provide personal guidance or assume responsibility, we urge caution and play it safe at first (at least until you know for sure).

## Onsite Technology

### Golden Clouds Technology Map

The house has modern internet and security features. From high-speed fiber-optic internet to automated lighting that changes colors through-out the day, you can rest and/or work from paradise. Above is a topological map of these features.

![tech map smaller](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/173123965-d574ac07-489b-4eac-bdef-5fd4691628f5.png)

### Wi-Fi

This is the same kind of Wi-Fi that you’ve used to using at airports, hospitals, stadiums, etc. 

1. Connect to `Golden Clouds Guest`, there is no password.
2. Your device should automatically open the ToS webpage (if it doesn't open a webbrowser and try to load any website)
3. Accept the ToS and you're done.

This what the ToS page looks like:

### Security Cameras

There are security cameras on the property, please read an understand this section. The 3 internal cameras only face the common areas; **Living Room**, **Game Room** and **Hallway**.

* These are disabled while there is a guest on the property
  * You can confirm a camera is disabled because there is no blue operational light. **If you see the blue light turned on, contact Lance ASAP** so we can turn it off immediately.
  * ![g3 instant](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3520532/173119017-314d9687-0a32-48be-b860-fb89e9156fd8.png) 
* Optional: Overnight Security - If you would like the security cameras to detect motion while you are sleeping, let us know. We can enable just the overnight schedule, which only detects and records motion between 0:00-4:00. To protect your privacy, we will ony enable this if you ask for it.

> There are two temporary WiZ cameras: one in the living room on top of the blinds,  and one on the window sill that faces the back yard facing the yard (on the window sill). The internal camera will be rotated to face the wall while a guest is present. If you see this facing the living room, contact Lance immediately so we can fix it.
